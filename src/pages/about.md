Welcome to CodeLog, a tech blog driven by a passion for software engineering.

My name is Eugene, as a software engineer with over 10 years of experience, I’ve had the privilege of creating solutions using multiple technologies. Throughout my career, I’ve led teams, mentored developers, and helped shape impactful projects that translate complex requirements into intuitive solutions.

At CodeLog, I share insights, lessons, and best practices from my journey in the software development world. Whether you're building modern web applications, exploring new frameworks, or seeking ways to improve your development process, this blog is a space for developers of all levels to learn, grow, and be inspired.

Join me as we dive into topics like frontend technologies, programming language creation, backend architectures and others.
