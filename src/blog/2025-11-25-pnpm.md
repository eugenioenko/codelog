# Why pnpm is a fantastic package manager

`pnpm` (performant npm) has become the go-to choice for developers who want better performance, disk efficiency, and stricter dependency management compared to traditional `npm`. Here's why making the switch is worth considering and how to do it seamlessly.

## Why pnpm Outperforms npm

### Disk Space Efficiency

`pnpm`'s most compelling advantage is its smart approach to storing packages. Instead of duplicating packages across projects like `npm` does, `pnpm` uses a content-addressed storage system that stores each package version only once globally. If multiple projects share the same dependency, `pnpm` creates hard links to a single copy rather than duplicating it. This can save **gigabytes** of disk space in development environments with numerous projects.

### Faster Installation Speeds

Because `pnpm` leverages its global store and efficient caching, installation times are significantly faster than `npm`. For large projects or CI/CD pipelines, this speed improvement can be substantial.

### Stricter Dependency Management

`pnpm` prevents "phantom dependencies"—accessing packages not explicitly declared in your `package.json`. This forces better dependency practices and reduces implicit access issues that plague `npm`.

### Better Monorepo Support

`pnpm` has built-in workspace features for managing multiple packages seamlessly, making it ideal for large-scale monorepo projects.

## How to Migrate from npm to pnpm

### Step 1: Use the Migrate Command

The easiest way to switch is by running the `pnpm import` command:

```bash
pnpm import package-lock.json
```

This command reads your existing `package-lock.json` and generates a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file with the same dependency information.

### Step 2: Clean Up and Install

Delete the old lockfile and install with `pnpm`:

```bash
rm package-lock.json
pnpm install
```

## Using Interactive Upgrade

To selectively update your dependencies, use the `--interactive` (or `-i`) flag:

```bash
pnpm update -i
```

This command displays all outdated dependencies and lets you choose which ones to upgrade interactively, giving you fine-grained control over your updates. Use `-L` --latest to upgrade to latest.

```bash
pnpm update -i -L
```

## The Bottom Line

`pnpm` delivers faster installations, better disk usage, and stricter dependency management—making it an excellent choice for modern JavaScript projects. The migration is straightforward, and the benefits are immediate. Try it out!
