Welcome to CodeLog! A personal tech blog by Eugene.

This project is my digital space to share what I learn, build, and discover as a software engineer. Here, you’ll find my thoughts on modern web development, tutorials, best practices, and stories from my journey in tech. My goal is to make complex topics approachable and to help others grow, whether you’re just starting out or have years of experience.

## What’s Inside

- Personal insights and lessons from real-world projects
- Tutorials on web development, frameworks, and tools
- Best practices for writing clean, maintainable code
- Experiments with new technologies and ideas

## Getting Started

To run the blog locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Why CodeLog?

I created CodeLog to document my growth, connect with other developers, and give back to the community. I believe in sharing knowledge openly and learning together.
